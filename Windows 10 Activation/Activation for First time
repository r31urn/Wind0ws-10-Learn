Quote " A Windows product key is a 25-character code used to activate Windows. It looks like this:

PRODUCT KEY: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX " 
Where to find your product key depends on how you got your copy of Windows:

->From an authorized retailer. The product key is on a label or card inside the box that Windows came in.
->A new PC running Windows. The product key is pre-installed on your PC, included with the packaging the PC came in, or included on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) attached to the PC.
->A digital copy from a Microsoft website. The product key is in the confirmation email you received after buying it. Or, it may be distributed as a digital license if you bought Windows 10, in which case it doesn't include a product key.
->Free upgrade to Windows 10. If you upgraded to Windows 10 for free from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, you should have a digital license instead of a product key.
