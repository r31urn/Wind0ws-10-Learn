# Refer -> https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12440/windows-10-activation


Windows 10 Activation works this way
--> If you have upgraded from Windows 7/8.1 to 10 --> Digital licence based on hardware ID, And the previous product key.
    (Previous version product key can be used to activate windows 10 but was feature was removed after Jan 2017).
--> If you have a OEM product key 5x5 code includes oem dm/ coa non spl/dwgrd , uses the product key + digital licence based on the hardware ID.
--> If you purchase a Windows 10 product key from retail store (Physical copy of the product key or DPK) 5x5 code, uses the product key + digital licence based on the hardware ID.
(In above cases you can actually remove the product key and do a clean install and still activate on the same hardware with out the key--> Digital linked to the hardware. )
--> If you buy it directly from the store, then the license is linked to your MSA (Microsoft account) and your hardware ID.
In all the cases the licenses can be linked to your MSA
There is no Product key in the store purchase as a digital license (Nothing as such as its stored on sever as a 5x5 or can be retrieved to a 5x5 code) .

The devices listed on your Microsoft account (https://account.microsoft.com/devices) are just the devices linked to your account (Logged in with your account regardless of activation, type of product key used (VL-MAK GVLK MSDN OEM Retail )Its the devices logged in with your account.

First one is where only a Window 10 sticker on the computer (Product key is digitally injected in the computer (WMIC command will retrieve the key or the showkeyplus :p)
Second is where a Windows product key is printed on the a sticker and usually stuck to the tower , you 90% of the time will have to enter the product key to activate (System builder will do this most often like CyberPC UK or NCIX in US,, etc).
Third is the same , OEM SPL is disconnected except the in rare sever scenarios so its always (NON SPL)
Forth being when you order a computer with Windows 10 Home and you want to upgarde you add a Windows 10 pro during a purchase then you will get a machine with a Windows 10 Home and sticker of the Windows 10 Pro key, you will need to enter the key to upgrade.
