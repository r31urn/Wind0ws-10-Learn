Forget CB CBB LTSB

Naming Changed

--> Semi-Annual Channel - We will be referreing to Current Branch (CB) as "Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)", while Current Branch for Business (CBB) will simply be referred to as "Semi-Annual Channel"
--> Long-Term Servicing Channel. These are less frequent releases, expected every 2-3 years (with the next one expected in 2019), designed for special-purpose PCs such as those used in point-of-sale systems or controlling factory or medical equipment.  Each of these releases will be serviced for 10 years from the date of release.  (The Long-Term Servicing Channel replaces the Long-Term Servicing Branch [LTSB].)

If you are not any major enterprise owning 1000s of PCs or something like that. You just fall into Semi - Annual,
  that is you will get a major update in somewhere 2 a year.

                                      --> you can even play around Group policy and registry. 
Windows 10 Enterprise, LTSB           --> You are the BOSS.

Windows 10 Pro price would not be justified if you a home user.
